              THE TEXAS OLIVE RANCH
            </h1>
            <p>
            Located in Carrizo Springs, Texas the sprawling Texas Olive Ranch boasts hundreds of acres and is home to more than 50,000 prosperous Arbequina, Arbosana, and Koroneiki olive trees.<br>

          The sandy Lome soil in South Texas, the best growing region in Texas, reminded our founder Jim Henry of the south of Spain, where the famous Arbequina trees flourish and produce some of the worldâ€™s best olive oil. With a commitment to the land and a pioneering spirit, we pride ourselves on producing our very own world-class, Texas grown Olive Oil.</p>

            <h1> ABOUT US</h1>
            <h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
            <p> At Texas Olive Ranch we not only grow all of our own olives, but we also press them ourselves We care for and oversee all aspects of the olive oil production process. This approach allows us to craft the highest quality olive oil that we are proud to put our names on.<br><br>

In addition to our olive oil production, we also strive to leave a lasting impact on our beautiful South Texas region. To keep our footprint small, we process all of our tree trimmings into mulch and feed leftover olive mash to our ranch animals, who in turn will fertilize the orchard.</p>

            <h3>HOW WE DO IT</h3>
            <p> Using a combination of mechanical and hand-picked harvesting during the month of October, our olives are immediately pressed on-site to maintain the freshest flavor possible. Our time-tested harvesting and olive oil production techniques are passed down through the Henry family to ensure we will offer quality olive oil for generations to come.
